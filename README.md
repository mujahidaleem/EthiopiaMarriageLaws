An analysis of the cultural effects of Ethiopia's Child Marriage Law in 2000-2019.

The practice of child marriage in poorer countries has been a prevalent issue in development 
economics. The perpetuation of child marriage has correlated with extreme poverty and has impeded 
efforts to achieve equity and economic growth. In McGavock’s paper, “Here waits the bride? The effect 
of Ethiopia’s Child marriage law” (2021), observes the causal impact of the “Revised Family Code” on 
the age of first marriage of women in Ethiopia. The marriage law was implemented by the Federal 
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in July 2000, which raised the legal minimum age of marriage for 
women from 15 to 18 years old and left the men’s minimum age of marriage unchanged at 18. The reform 
also guaranteed the equality of the spouses during the conclusion, duration, and dissolution of marriage. 
However, this law allowed for marriages of girls at 16 and 17 only with parental consent. In the paper, 
McGavock (2021) deduces the effect of Ethiopia’s reform of child marriage, where she concluded that the 
law resulted in a decrease in the probability of women getting married earlier. This was attributed to 
delays in under-age marriages among the younger girls (i.e., marriages involving girls under age 16) 
which then led to lower total lifetime fertility.

To estimate the effect of the Revised Family Code, McGavock (2021) compares the average age 
of women married during the 10 years pre-and post-reform and then takes advantage of the staggered 
timing of the reform in each region (i.e., region derives from Ethiopia’s nine semi-autonomous regions: 
Addis Abba, Dire Dawa, Oromia, Amhara, SNNPR, Benishangul-Gumuz, Tigray, Harari, and Gambela). 
In her report, McGavock (2021) primarily focuses on the short-term effect of the implementation of the 
reform as she only considers the period of 2000-2010 (i.e., post-reform period) and 1990-1999 (i.e., prereform period). We believe that to analyze the long-term effect of this law is to extend the post-reform 
period by approximately a decade. Therefore, we extend upon McGavock’s (2021) study by including the
year 2016 in the post-reform period. We then observe the average change in the first marriage age in 
women by comparing this to the pre-reform period (i.e., 1990-1999) to gain a sense of the long-term 
effects of the law.
